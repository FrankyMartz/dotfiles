# Personal OSX Workspace
Designed with Simplicity, Functionality, and Performance in mind.

*NOTE: Please, be aware that these files are always in a constant flux.*

## Requirements
Don't worry most of these are pretty basic. I hate bloat and cruft too!

- Base OSX Tools
- Internet Connection

## Installation
```bash
# Clone or Fork repository
git clone git@github.com:FrankyMartz/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

# Enter the Dragon
cd ~/.dotfiles

# Shaazam!
./install
```
Yep, that's it.

## Q&A
### I want to contribute?
Sorry, but I use this configuration daily. I will __NOT__ be accepting pull requests.

### What about your [FrankyMartz/vimrc][vimrc] repository?
It will be refactored for basic Vim use. The default Vim configuration is atrocious; that repository will be aimed at making server edits a little more pleasant.
